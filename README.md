📌 Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

🔹 Project Title
Tic-Tac-Toe AI Using Minimax Algorithm

🔹 Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe game in which an AI player competes against a human player.
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal decisions and ensures that it never loses the game.

🔹 Project Description

This is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python.
In this game:
The human player plays as X
The AI plays as O
The AI evaluates all possible future game states using the Minimax algorithm
Based on this evaluation, the AI selects the best possible move
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in game theory and artificial intelligence.

🔹 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Algorithm: Minimax
Concepts Used:
Artificial Intelligence
Game Theory
Recursion

Decision Making

🔹 How to Run the Project
Step 1: Install Python
Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system.
Step 2: Open Terminal / Command Prompt
Navigate to the project directory.
Step 3: Run the Program
python tictactoe_ai.py

🔹 Game Instructions

The Tic-Tac-Toe board positions are numbered from 0 to 8:

0 | 1 | 2
---------
3 | 4 | 5
---------
6 | 7 | 8


Enter a number between 0 and 8 to make your move.

The AI will automatically make its move after the human player.

🔹 Features

✔ Unbeatable AI player
✔ Uses Minimax decision-making algorithm
✔ Simple and clean console interface
✔ Beginner-friendly and well-structured code
✔ Demonstrates core AI concepts

🔹 Sample Output
You are X | AI is O
Enter your move (0-8): 4
AI Wins!

🔹 Limitations

Console-based application (no graphical interface)
Fixed board size (3x3)
Single-player mode only
🔹 Future Enhancements

Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
Implement difficulty levels
Add multiplayer support

Optimize performance using Alpha-Beta Pruning

🔹 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of Artificial Intelligence in games using the Minimax algorithm.
The AI always plays optimally, making it an excellent example of decision-making in AI systems.
